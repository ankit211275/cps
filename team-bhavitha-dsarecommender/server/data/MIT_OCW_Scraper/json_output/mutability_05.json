  "content": "Mutability refers to whether an objectâ€™s contents can be changed after creation. Lists are mutable, while tuples are not. Mutable objects can cause unexpected side effects when shared between parts of a program. Understanding mutability is essential for managing data flow, debugging, and writing robust functions."
